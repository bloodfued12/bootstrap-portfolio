# bootstrap portfolio
## What was your motivation?
 My motivation for this project was showcasing my current knowledge and learning and consolidating my skills with application of the framework.
## Why did you build this project?
This is a portfolio project to help showcase my skills as a bootstrap and in general front end web developer.
Alongside this it also gives me the experiences of finding out solutions to problems which have arisen within my code and allowing me to figure out what exactly went wrong.
## What problem does it solve? 
The portfolio itself solves the problem of my current portfolio being quite dense with code which with the application of bootstrap has been reduced considerably. 
 ## What did you learn? 
From this project I have learnt that the Bootstrap framework makes quick and efficient use to make a brilliant website with quick deployment since the css has already been pre-written. 
This project has also given me more confidence and knowledge in using a cdn and applying it to a website. 
## What makes your project stand out?
I have high hopes that with the applicable knowledge that I have learnt from this project that I will confidently be able to continue and achieve competency with the upcoming languages later in the course work.
I also think that this project would help me to stand out when potential employers look at this work and see that I am a competent learner that can pick up and improve upon the knowledge that I have been given with ease.
